# EVER Wallet App

Ever Wallet allows you to display multiple account cards in your wallet and quickly switch between them.\
For example, it could be your main account and a [multisignature wallet](../../multisig/).

## Add account

### Create a new account

1. In the `Wallet` section, swipe the account card to the left to open the `Add new account` section
2. Select `Add a new account`
3. Choose a name for your account
4. Select the [type ](../../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/types-of-account.md)of account you want to create and click `Confirm`

{% hint style="success" %}
Done! Your new account has been successfully created and its card has been added to the Wallet section.

If the [type ](../../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/types-of-account.md)of account created requires it, proceed with its [deployment](../../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/deploy/).
{% endhint %}

## Manage account

Accounts can be managed in two ways:

1. In the `Wallet` section
2. In the `Manage seeds & accounts` section

In the first case, you just need to tap on the three dots in the upper right part of the account card you are interested in:

* **Preferences** - in this menu you can rename the account, copy the wallet address and QR code, and open the account page in the blockchain explorer.&#x20;
* **Custodians** - this menu displays a list of custodians in your [multisig wallet](../../multisig/).&#x20;
* **Remove account** - by clicking, you can remove the account from the displayed ones.

In the second case, you will need to:

1. Go to `Profile`
2. Go to `Manage seeds & accounts`
3. Select the `seed` and then the `key` where the account you need is located

There you will find a list of all the accounts linked to this key. \
You can manage the account by clicking on the three dots of the account you need.

Also note that you can add a new account in this menu.
