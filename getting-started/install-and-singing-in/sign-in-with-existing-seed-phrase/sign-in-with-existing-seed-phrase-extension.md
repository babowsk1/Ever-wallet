# Sign in with existing seed phrase Extension

If you have already created a wallet on the Everscale network, you can add it to your EVER Wallet using your existing seed phrase.

### If you haven't added another seed yet:

1. Click on the EVER Wallet icon in the Chrome extensions menu to go to the wallet creation/login page.
2. Select `Sign in with seed phrase`.
3. Create a `password`. It will be used to confirm transactions.
