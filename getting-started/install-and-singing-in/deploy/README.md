# Deploy

When you create a new account/wallet, you need to deploy it.

Some account types, including the standard account (EVER Wallet), are deployed automatically - sending, staking EVER, and other actions will be available to you immediately after the first deposit:

However, some types (such as [Multisig](../../../multisig/)) require manual deployment. \
So, the sequence for deploying an account is as follows:

1. If you haven't done this before, go to the [add new account](https://docs.everwallet.net/seed-phrase-keys-and-accounts/account-management/ever-wallet-extension#create-new) interface and select the [account type](../types-of-account.md)
2. Deposit a small amount of EVER to the balance of this account in [any way](../../how-to-get-ever.md) convenient for you
3. After deposit you will be able for deployment - click on the corresponding button
4. Choose wallet type: Standard or [Multisig](../../../multisig/)
5. Click Next and then Deploy
6. Confirm the transaction in the Ever Wallet window that opens and wait for it to complete
7. Once the transaction is complete, you will be able to send and stake EVER

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the wallet.
