# Creating a new wallet Extension

{% hint style="info" %}
When you open the Ever Wallet extension, you will be prompted to create a new wallet or [log in with a previously created seed phrase](../sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase/sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase-extension.md).
{% endhint %}

1. Click on the EVER Wallet icon in the Chrome extensions menu to go to the wallet creation/login page.
2. Select `Create a new wallet`.
3. Write down and/or copy and otherwise save in a secure manner the displayed `seed phrase`. The seed phrase is your proof of ownership of the wallet and the only way to gain or [regain access to its management](../sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase/sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase-extension.md).
4. Pass through the seed phrase verification process.&#x20;
5. Create a `password`. It will be used to confirm transactions.
