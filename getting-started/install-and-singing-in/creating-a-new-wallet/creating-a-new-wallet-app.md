# Creating a new wallet App

{% hint style="info" %}
When you open the Ever Wallet app, you will be prompted to create a new wallet or [log in with a previously created seed phrase.](../sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase/sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase-app.md)
{% endhint %}

## Create a new wallet

1. Select `Create a new wallet`
2. Write down and/or copy and otherwise save in a secure manner the displayed `seed phrase`. The seed phrase is your proof of ownership of the wallet and the only way to gain or [regain access to its management](../sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase/sign-in-with-existing-seed-phrase-app.md).
3. Chech the phrase if you feel it is necessary or skip this step.
4. Create a `password`. It will be used to confirm transactions.\
   Enable biometrics if you think it is necessary.
